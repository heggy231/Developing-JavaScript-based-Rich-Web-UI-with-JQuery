The difference btwn library and framework:
- lib: convenient features put together
- framework: creating 

- DOM document object transverse get to each node 
- event handling: capturing human interaction
- animating:
- Ajax interactions: way of communicating in a network

Ajax browser asynchronoous Asynchronous javascript And xml
why xml - embed meta data, standard way of communication
jason - Javascript object notation

Front end community: jQuery based on css query language.

Difference btwn minified vs uncompressed:
  for server: it only sees string
  network foot print depends on the size of it

- div, span types (tag)
- element hierachy: looking for span element that is direct children
  (Hello and world is direct children of div)

<div id = "foo" class= "bar">
  <span> Hello </span>
  <span> World </span>
</div>

Execute method (function)
- all queries are functions

- chaining method: once you are done with one function then do more job
  ex) get me the first child, get inner text, bold it
- javascript does not compile but sequential

- selector: a native property for javascript, identifying combination
selector is way of describing nodes and its attributor of node
in other word: selector is an expression of identifying an element

jQuery()

whenever you run the selector  >> it takes lot of optimization of selector query, I just selected $("#ok_button")  
  by method chaining, we are transfering DOM once 
  where if you reapeat- 

jQuery Selector

-- note: descendant - tree DOM world any order inside div parent/ great parent, great great parent

- direct children: $("div > button")

* way of id quickly and easily: 
- Form filters: input type,
- visibility: which element has visibility hidden 

- jQuery Selectors
  - ("selector1, selector2, selectorN") and operations
  - ("*") wild card

- Attribute: html (hyper markup language) xml (extendable markup)
node start    node end
<abc> ...     </abc> node definition ends here

- every expression of attribute is key: value pair
<div id= class= >

<div data-ucsc="jquery"> //purpose is data, parsing 
what is semantic html?

Attributes: 

teacher name Subhadeep Chatterjee
:contains()
<span>hello</span>

:parent -- selectoring under what has its parent

Form filters- 
radio button- has state

:visibility
css value - visible (2 values: make it visible visibility: hidden;visible)
display: none; and visibility: hidden;

why we have 2 different visibility and display?
- how browser's render, strucuture of DOM 

visiblity: doesn't recalculate all browser
display: browser has to recalbulate everything.
