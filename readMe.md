The difference btwn library and framework:
- lib: convenient features put together
- framework: creating 

- DOM document object transverse get to each node 
- event handling: capturing human interaction
- animating:
- Ajax interactions: way of communicating in a network

Ajax browser asynchronoous Asynchronous javascript And xml
why xml - embed meta data, standard way of communication
jason - Javascript object notation

Front end community: jQuery based on css query language.

Difference btwn minified vs uncompressed:
  for server: it only sees string
  network foot print depends on the size of it

- div, span types (tag)
- element hierachy: looking for span element that is direct children
  (Hello and world is direct children of div)

<div id = "foo" class= "bar">
  <span> Hello </span>
  <span> World </span>

</div>
